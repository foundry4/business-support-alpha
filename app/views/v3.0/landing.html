			Small businesses all over the UK are eligible for support from the government. 
		</p>
		<p class="landing">
			Growth looks different for every business; you might be launching a new market,
			 upskilling your workforce, increasing your revenue – or something else entirely. 
			The government is committed to providing small business owners with the tools they need to achieve their goals, for free.
		</p>
		<p class="landing">
			Finding a business mentor, growing your network of peers, attending workshops, taking an online course, 
			securing a loan or grant: these are just some of the ways you can develop your business through government-backed schemes. 
		</p>
		<p class="landing">
			No two businesses are the same, so no two businesses need the same support. 
			View results tailored to your individual requirements and take the next step to growing your business today.
